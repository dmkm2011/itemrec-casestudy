		<h1>RACOFI: Rule-Applying Collaborative Filtering - parsers package.</h1>

		<p> This package provides some parser code to parse some standard data sets,
		among them are the Jester data set and the MovieLens data set. The Jester
		data set come in an excel file that one can export as CSV (comma separated) and
		then parse using this package. Parsed files can be outputed to a custom binary
		format. By convention, these binary files go in the ~/CFData directory (Unix-based
		systems).</p>
