function [ output_args ] = constructGraph( input_args )
%CONSTRUCTGRAPH Construct a bipartite users-items graph.
%   This function will create the graph with all information.
%   The result is a sparse matrix represent this graph, which 
%   then will be used with MatlabBGL.

% maybe after construct the graph,
% we will store the graph into a *.mat file,
% to avoid creating the graph again and again.
